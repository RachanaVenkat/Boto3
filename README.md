# Cloud cost optimization using Boto3

### Introduction

What are the reasons for companies to migrate from on-premises servers to the Cloud? 
- Maintenance Overhead
- Highly Expensive
- Not very efficient

What if a company migrated to the Cloud and these problems still exist? What if the costs aren't being saved either?
Is it the cloud provider's fault? No. It is a shared responsibilty.
To explain it - cloud providers like AWS, Azure etc, provide you with numerous services for compute, storage, monitoring and many more, with least amount of effort on your end. This doesn't mean you can use the resources irresponsibly, it will incur additional charges and you won't benefit from the migration. So, it is a shared responsibility. Use resources responsibly, reap all the benefits.



### Description

A Lambda function is developed utilizing AWS Boto3 services to automate the identification and deletion of stale snapshots, thus optimizing cloud expenses. This function efficiently manages AWS resources by identifying snapshots that are no longer needed and removing them, thereby reducing unnecessary storage costs. Through proactive management of snapshots, the Lambda function contributes to cost optimization strategies within AWS environments.
