# Cloud cost optimization using Boto3
### Description

A Lambda function is developed utilizing AWS Boto3 services to automate the identification and deletion of stale snapshots, thus optimizing cloud expenses. This function efficiently manages AWS resources by identifying snapshots that are no longer needed and removing them, thereby reducing unnecessary storage costs. Through proactive management of snapshots, the Lambda function contributes to cost optimization strategies within AWS environments.
